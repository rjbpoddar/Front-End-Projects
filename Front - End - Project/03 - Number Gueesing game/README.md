# Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

In this game, the player is prompted to guess a random number between 1 and 100. They have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. If the player fails to guess the correct number within the allowed number of attempts, the game ends, revealing the correct number. The player can then choose to start a new game and try again.

2. Enter your guess in the input field provided.
3. Click the "Submit guess" button to submit your guess.
